I'm presently (as of writing) a cloud developer advocate at Microsoft. That means I talk to people why I think Azure is a pretty cool place to deploy your code. I write a lot of code demos and help with some open source libraries. I've taught a lot of lessons on <a href=\\\"https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/brian-holt/\\\">Frontend Masters</a> and used to be on the frontend development podcast <a href=\\\"http://frontendhappyhour.com/\\\">Front End Happy Hour</a>. Previous to that, I was a senior or staff JavaScript and Node engineer at LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit, Needle, KSL.com, and NuSkin.</p>\\n<p>My biggest passions in life are people and experiences. I hope by going through this course that it can improve your life in some meaningful way and that you in turn can improve someone else's life. My beautiful wife and I live in Seattle, Washington in the United States of America with our cute little Havanese dog Luna. I'd almost always rather be traveling and have been fortunate to see over thirty countries in the past five years.</p>\\n<p>Please catch up with me on social media, would love to chat:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/holtbt\\\">Twitter</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/briantholt/\\\">Instagram</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/btholt\\\">GitHub</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/btholt/\\\">LinkedIn</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"why-was-this-course-created\\\"><a href=\\\"#why-was-this-course-created\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Why was this course created?</h2>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-a3d33.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 25.497630331753555%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAm0lEQVQY02NgGAhw0VCb+YCuRgQIr1RX5jihrymKV4OdnZ2cvb29LBBLODg4SAD5KkAsAuIDafGV+tpNh3U1VPfoqO8C4o6DuhqRQL4a0AI3IK17SFfD7KiepgyygSAD5IEGaAFpIyBtDKQtgBjEt203MXQAGlILxFVAQ6YAcRcQLwTiyUA8EYibD+ioNxLt5XMG2sxAF0gRoxYAu0Q0UPEUUdYAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Frontend Masters Logo\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-10273.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-9b14a.png 163w,\\n/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-94962.png 325w,\\n/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-10273.png 650w,\\n/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-2fc6f.png 975w,\\n/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-a3d33.png 1055w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>I love to teach. It's a challenging task that forces you to peel back all the knowledge you've gained so you can approach someone who lacks the same experience and terminology you have. It forces you to take amorphous concepts floating in your brain and crystalize them into solid concepts that you can describe. It forces you to acknowledge your gaps in knowledge because you'll begin to question things you know others will question. For me to ever master a concept, I have to teach it to someone else.</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately life gets in the way. These courses take dozens of hours to prepare and to get right.

While entry-level jobs are out there and you can get them with months of work, I guarantee you you'll have to work hard for them.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"who-am-i\\\"><a href=\\\"#who-am-i\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Who Am I?</h2>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/intro-to-js/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-59562.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Brian drinking a beer\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/intro-to-js/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-b80fa.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/intro-to-js/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/intro-to-js/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/intro-to-js/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/intro-to-js/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/intro-to-js/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-59562.jpg 1080w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>My name is Brian Holt. I'm presently (as of writing) a cloud developer advocate at Microsoft. That means I talk to people why I think Azure is a pretty cool place to deploy your code. I write a lot of code demos and help with some open source libraries. I've taught a lot of lessons on <a href=\\\"https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/brian-holt/\\\">Frontend Masters</a> and used to be on the frontend development podcast <a href=\\\"http://frontendhappyhour.com/\\\">Front End Happy Hour</a>. Previous to that, I was a senior or staff JavaScript and Node engineer at LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit, Needle, KSL.com, and NuSkin.</p>\\n<p>My biggest passions in life are people and experiences. I hope by going through this course that it can improve your life in some meaningful way and that you in turn can improve someone else's life. My beautiful wife and I live in Seattle, Washington in the United States of America with our cute little Havanese dog Luna. I'd almost always rather be traveling and have been fortunate to see over thirty countries in the past five years.</p>\\n<p>Please catch up with me on social media, would love to chat:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/holtbt\\\">Twitter</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/briantholt/\\\">Instagram</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/btholt\\\">GitHub</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/btholt/\\\">LinkedIn</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"why-was-this-course-created\\\"><a href=\\\"#why-was-this-course-created\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Why was this course created?</h2>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-a3d33.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 25.497630331753555%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAm0lEQVQY02NgGAhw0VCb+YCuRgQIr1RX5jihrymKV4OdnZ2cvb29LBBLODg4SAD5KkAsAuIDafGV+tpNh3U1VPfoqO8C4o6DuhqRQL4a0AI3IK17SFfD7KiepgyygSAD5IEGaAFpIyBtDKQtgBjEt203MXQAGlILxFVAQ6YAcRcQLwTiyUA8EYibD+ioNxLt5XMG2sxAF0gRoxYAu0Q0UPEUUdYAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Frontend Masters Logo\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-10273.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-9b14a.png 163w,\\n/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-94962.png 325w,\\n/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-10273.png 650w,\\n/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-2fc6f.png 975w,\\n/intro-to-js/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-a3d33.png 1055w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>I love to teach. It's a challenging task that forces you to peel back all the knowledge you've gained so you can approach someone who lacks the same experience and terminology you have. It forces you to take amorphous concepts floating in your brain and crystalize them into solid concepts that you can describe. It forces you to acknowledge your gaps in knowledge because you'll begin to question things you know others will question. For me to ever master a concept, I have to teach it to someone else.</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately life gets in the way. These courses take dozens of hours to prepare and to get right. While I'd love to just create content all day, I have a (awesome) day job at Microsoft that demands and deserves my full attention. However I'm grateful to the team at <a href=\\\"https://frontendmasters.com/\\\">Frontend Masters</a> for giving me deadlines and incentive to create these courses and then allowing and encouraging me to open source the materials. Not everyone has the money to pay for these courses which is why these materials are and will be forever open source for you to reference and share. I think the video content is pretty good too and so I'd encourage you to <a href=\\\"https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/\\\">take a look at the videos on Frontend Masters</a> too if that's in the cards for you.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/intro\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the Course\",\"order\":0}},\"allMarkdownRemark\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":0,\"path\":\"/intro\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":1,\"path\":\"/overview\",\"title\":\"Introduction to JavaScript?\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":2,\"path\":\"/tools\",\"title\":\"Systems\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":3,\"path\":\"/variable\",\"title\":\"What is Variable\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":4,\"path\":\"/html-next-steps\",\"title\":\"HTML Next Steps\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":5,\"path\":\"/meta-html\",\"title\":\"Meta HTML\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":6,\"path\":\"/basic-css\",\"title\":\"Basic CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":7,\"path\":\"/selectors\",\"title\":\"CSS Selectors and the Cascade\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":8,\"path\":\"/layout-css\",\"title\":\"Layout CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":9,\"path\":\"/css-patterns\",\"title\":\"Effective Patterns for Writing CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":10,\"path\":\"/project-html-css\",\"title\":\"Project: HTML & CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":11,\"path\":\"/programming-fundamentals\",\"title\":\"Programming Fundamentals\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":12,\"path\":\"/functions-and-scope\",\"title\":\"Functions and Scope\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":13,\"path\":\"/objects-and-arrays\",\"title\":\"Objects and Arrays\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":14,\"path\":\"/dom\",\"title\":\"The DOM\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":15,\"path\":\"/js-project\",\"title\":\"JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Project\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":16,\"path\":\"/ajax\",\"title\":\"AJAX\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":17,\"path\":\"/libraries\",\"title\":\"Integrating with Other People's Libraries\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":18,\"path\":\"/git-and-bash\",\"title\":\"Git and Bash\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":19,\"path\":\"/node\",\"title\":\"Node.js\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":20,\"path\":\"/deploying\",\"title\":\"Deploying Your App\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":21,\"path\":\"/final-thoughts\",\"title\":\"Final Thoughts\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/intro.json\n// module id = 470\n// module chunks = 264533715932505"],"sourceRoot":""}
